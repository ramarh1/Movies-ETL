# Movies-ETL
 
## Project Overview
This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to refactor code from the module to create a function that takes in three files-Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, then perform the ETL process as well as adding the clean data to a PostgreSQL database.
